# MechCheatSheet
A tool for a game '[Evolve](https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/)' by @pmotschmann, to display and analyze all things related to mechs.

Hosted here (https://akudeukie.github.io/MechCheatSheet/)
## Spire floor data
Configure desired spire floor or import it from save data to get breakdown of:
- Mech effectiveness in different terrain types
- Boss resistances to weapons
- Equipment recommendations to combat spire hazards

## Mech constructor
Build out a dummy mech to see in great detail how selected conditions affect mech effectiveness. Finally figure out what's best to do on a cursed Flooded Windy Jungle floor with Tar pits.

## Mech list
Add said mech to the list for future refence. Lists are free to be used in anyway one wishes. Be creative. There are multiple pages. And one of them displays information about mech bay from imported save, if it is present. Or hide the lists with an eye icon, if they are too distracting.

## But wait... There's more
Building single, the most effecient mech is not the only way to go. Maybe putting a varied list of diverse mechs, running the game in background and forgetting about it for a while is more desirable.
Behind _calculator_ icon hides a tool to throw some "big data" at the screen. It generates loads of random floors and collates data about how current mech list fares on avarage. 

Hopefuly this can provide some insights for building out varied enough mech fleet.
